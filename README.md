# EduEasy(Education Assistant)

## Abstract
College admissions are stressful for everyone involved. That includes the applicant, teachers, counselors, and mentors. That being said, few will feel this stress as acutely as parents. After class 12th Science results being out, parents and students are facing problems to find appropriate IITs as per student’s results and interest. They might have gone through various websites such as individual IIT websites, ‘quora’, ‘career360’ etc. and consult various people to find out which IIT is best for student. Relying on others reviews gives biased and subjective answers. For all these tasks it might take too much time and effort and in turn sometimes they might not get satisfactory and to the point answers.

We understand the unique pressure felt by the parents of college applicants. To overcome these problem we came up with a NLP (Natural Language Processing) based solution named ‘EduEasy’ - A Conversational Agent which provides below functionalities.

Solution will provide fact based answer to the user - Displays answer considering facts from authentic website named NIRF(National Institutional Ranking Framework) regarding parameters such as IIT placements, ranking, previous cut-off marks, notable faculties and reviews of alumni which are more optimized, accurate, factual and authentic data compared to normal search engines provides. 

System will also have functionality to show if user may get admission in specific IIT or not based on previous year admission criteria, cut off and student’s current marks. 

This solution in turn, helps parents and students to get queries solved regarding IITs on the go. 

The scope of answering is not only limited to ‘English’ language, but also understand and answer in ‘Hindi’ language which gives more flexibility to end users. 

Addition of ‘Speech  To Text’ makes chatbot more user friendly, as it provides easy accessibility to the parents who lives in the remote area and not familiar with typing. Hence users can interact with system using their own voice and get answers. 

This system can be further personalized or generalized for specific colleges / universities with the required changes.
